### Todo:
* Responsiveness
* remove unnecessary or repeatitive code
* add catch method to update auth_token after an hour in localStorage otherwise the app will likely crash
* check for any memory leaks etc if there are any in the whole app just to make sure everything stays real fast
* add api version to env and replace calls with that (optional ig)
* just look at the code once more, idk im sick so not working that well so just check if i accidently did something wrong

That's it ig, I'll do the first one when i wake up(Responsiveness one), the rest you can do most are just testing, I'm not good in writing clean or what we call it "understandable code" so you're gonna have to check that yourself. 

Also, I'm sick so my skills are like 60% lower rn so just deal with it ig thats the best i can do rn.

I've attached the screenshots with the email.

Sayonara!
